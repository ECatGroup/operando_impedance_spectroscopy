# Self-Correcting Operando Impedance Spectroscopy Enables Dynamic Adaptability and Deep Mechanistic Insights of Electrochemical CO$_{2}$ Reduction

## Abstract
Electrochemical systems are inherently dynamic, often leading to unreliable performance assessments and even degrada-tion. To reliably evaluate and efficiently mitigate such behavior, we developed a self-correcting operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method, regulated by a custom Python script, enabling non-destructive, real-time, and adaptive control over electrochemical processes. The methods' applicability was demonstrated on electrochemical CO₂ reduction (ECO2R) on copper, a system known for its instability. By dynamically adjusting electrochemical parameters such as internal resistance compensation and applied potential based on live EIS feedback, we effectively neutralized bubble-induced artifacts and uncovered mechanistic insights into interfacial degradation. Furthermore, by integrating this adaptive control with a pulsating potential strategy, we successfully suppressed the long-term deactivation of ECO2R. Altogether, the results in this letter establish our method as a versatile operando framework to uncover, correct, and ultimately suppress artifacts arising from the dynamic behavior of electrochemical systems.

## Description
This repository contains the python code that was used in the scientific article 
*Self-Correcting Operando Impedance Spectroscopy Enables Dynamic Adaptability and Deep Mechanistic Insights of Electrochemical CO$_{2}$ Reduction*
by *B. Tomc et. al.*  

The reader should be aware, as stated in the article, that the potentiostat that was used for the experiments was from **PalmSens** so the software was written for that device in mind.  

For any other potentiostat the code can be freely modified to fit your needs, and it serves as a template for implementing similar functionality with different devices
